    <p>
        This is the recipe for traditional Cuban/Puerto Rican pastries
        that can only be found in some places. Our family goes crazy
         for them! Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons strawberry jam</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) jar guava paste, or as desired</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            Lightly flour a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll puff pastry into a thin sheet on a floured surface.
             Cut into squares about the length of your hand and place
              on the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat egg and water together in a bowl; brush each pastry
            square with egg wash. Stab each square a few times with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            Remove from oven and let cool at least 10 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix guava paste and jam together in a bowl until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Cut a large, vertical slit into each pastry. Spread 1 tablespoon
            guava mixture into each slit, making sure guava doesn't squeeze 
            out when closed.
        </li>
    </ol>
